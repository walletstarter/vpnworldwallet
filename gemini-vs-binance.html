  <p>When evaluating cryptocurrency exchanges in 2025, fee structures can make or break your trading profitability. Gemini and Binance are both globally recognized platforms — but their fee models differ significantly. This guide breaks down Gemini vs Binance fees across trading tiers, withdrawal costs, and passive income options.
Gemini’s standard web interface charges 1.49% per transaction, but its ActiveTrader interface offers dramatically lower fees starting at 0.40% maker / 0.20% taker — decreasing as volume increases. Binance, meanwhile, offers an ultra-low base rate of 0.10% with further discounts for BNB holders or VIPs.
Withdrawal fees also differ: Gemini supports free ACH transfers, but crypto withdrawals incur fixed fees. Binance has variable crypto withdrawal fees and limited fiat off-ramps in some countries due to regulatory pressure. For U.S. users, Binance.US lacks several features of the global site.
Gemini is more compliant and U.S.-friendly; Binance offers more assets and lower costs. If you're focused on compliance, banking integration, and trust, Gemini wins. If you’re optimizing for altcoin variety and fee minimization, Binance leads — but may carry more regulatory risk.

  <h2>Which Is Cheaper?</h2>
  <p>If you're a high-volume trader using Gemini's ActiveTrader interface, you can get fees close to or below Binance. However, casual users may find Binance cheaper for small transactions.</p>
