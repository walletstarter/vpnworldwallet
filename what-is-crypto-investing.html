  <h1>What is Crypto Investing?</h1>
  <img src="og-preview.png" alt="Illustration of cryptocurrency investing and growth strategy" width="512" height="512" loading="lazy" />
  <p>Crypto investing involves allocating capital to digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins with the goal of long-term growth or short-term profit. Unlike traditional investing, crypto markets operate 24/7 and are driven by different economic, social, and technological factors.</p>
  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> The foundational technology that powers cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Prices can swing dramatically, offering both opportunity and risk</li>
    <li><strong>Wallets:</strong> Tools to securely store crypto assets (hot vs cold storage)</li>
    <li><strong>Exchanges:</strong> Platforms like Gemini, Coinbase, and Binance to buy/sell crypto</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Benefits and Risks</h2>
  <p>Crypto investing can offer high returns but comes with unique risks including regulatory uncertainty, custodial security, and market manipulation. Diversification and research are essential for long-term success.</p>
