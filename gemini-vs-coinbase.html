    <p>Gemini vs Coinbase: Which Crypto Exchange Is Better in 2025?
    Gemini and Coinbase are two of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, but which one is better for you in 2025? In this detailed comparison, we analyze security, user experience, trading fees, and platform features to help new and experienced investors choose the right platform.
    Gemini is a New York-regulated crypto exchange with a strong emphasis on compliance and institutional-grade security. It supports over 70 assets, offers advanced trading via ActiveTrader, and has low fees on its pro interface. Coinbase, meanwhile, offers unmatched beginner usability and a broader altcoin selection â€” but often at higher costs.
    Both platforms offer FDIC-insured USD accounts, crypto vaults, mobile apps, and educational resources. Gemini prioritizes regulatory clarity and trust, while Coinbase leans into rapid retail adoption and staking.
    Ultimately, if youâ€™re looking for tighter spreads, transparent compliance, and U.S.-based regulation, Gemini may be the smarter choice in 2025. Coinbase remains excellent for beginners but can be more expensive without Coinbase One.
